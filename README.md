Keeping track of my learning of Java, computer science knowledge, and interview algorithms

Recently, I was reminded of what [niudai](https://github.com/niudai/How-to-be-a-good-programmer/blob/e54c22dd3c412ab46c074c723bb70547ccd8887d/doc/abilities/ability_task_driven.md) said about how continuous commits can bring continuous positive feedback. Additionally, I also wanted to document my own learning process. Since I have a habit of summarizing and writing articles, I uploaded my learning records.
